            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I like dancing! I used to be a gym-enjoyer, then I tried climbing, which I found very fun - but quite difficult!
            About one year ago I tried pole dancing for the first time and I never looked back! I think this sport combines
            athleticism with ...fun! To me it's a very creative way to stay active and connect with an empowering and very
            supportive community!</p>
            <aside>
                <p>Fun fact: my first pole dancing instructor was a full-time Software Engineer who taught this as a hobby!</p>
            </aside>
            If you would like to learn more about pole dancing, you can
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_dance" target="_blank">read more on Wikipedia</a>.

            <h2>Well-designed websites</h2>
            <p>Some websites I think are well-designed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://prezenta.roaep.ro/">prezenta.roaep.ro</a></p>
                    <p>The official portal for monitoring the voter presence and status of results for the elections in
                    Romania, making the electoral process transparent and accessible. It has a clean, easy to navigate UI,
                    it is responsive and provides live updates. Information is presented clearly in an intuitive, yet
                    seamless design.</p>
